## 👋 Hi there, I’m Sergio Flores

### 🌱 About Me
I have been enjoying data analysis ever since I started my first research paper, co-authoring [Length-flexible strategies for efficient SERS performance in gold-nanorod-gapped nanoantennas](https://doi.org/10.1186/s11671-025-04228-4) and since then I’ve been hooked on data science and machine learning. 

### 🛠 What I’m Working On
- **lol-multipath** (Go) — a UDP multipath project to optimize packet routing in League of Legends.  
- Diving deeper into **deep learning** architectures and statistical models. Currently interested in the topic of ergonomics and how this affect deep learning algorithms.

### 💻 Skills
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python · Go · SQL · PyTorch  
- **Dev Tools:** Git · Docker   
- **Data:** Data cleaning · Statistical analysis · Visualization (Matplotlib)
